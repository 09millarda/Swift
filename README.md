# Swift
Swift. A pretty difficult game I made in Unity. Thought it'd be fun.

Made in Unity in a couple of days. Most of that time was spent learning how the game engine worked. After that is was relatively straight forward.

Play it here: https://swiftgame.000webhostapp.com/   - PLAY IN FULL SCREEN MODE

For some reason the text is all squashed together... In the Unity editor it wasn't like this. I'm guessing that there are still some teething problems with Unity's WebGl exporter. 

AIM OF THE GAME:

Simple. A bar moves around a circle. Blocks spawn randomly around the circle and you must click the screen to make the blocks jump over the bar. A block may only jump once per revolution of the bar. A point is scored per revolution. You lose if the bar touches a block. Also, every 5 points, another block is added to the circle.

-- It is difficult to time the jumps correctly (at least for me...) but it is entirely possible. The maximum number of blocks that can spawn is 10. Good luck getting to that level though.

You can download the source code if you want. It was all pretty straight-forward except for the gravity and position calculations for the blocks (had to read up on matrix mathematics again...) so it is easy to pick up and understand. The code is commented as well with some descriptions given on the workings of the code.

Thanks for reading and checking the project out.
